			<p>Growing up, Korina Moreno (founder), did not have a platform where she could express the colorful life experiences, good or bad, that she was experiencing. She understands how important it is to have a place to share these experiences. She understands it is important for women to talk about these experiences to help and empower one another, specially as women of color.</p>

		<h1>Giving Back to the Latinx Community</h1>
		<p>Chika Xicana has family members who are DACA students and sees them struggling to make something of themselves. She sees and understands that many students have a hard time getting through school because of financial situations. Her cousins had a full time job and went to school full time. Chika Xicana saw the struggles that her cousins had gone through and knows that other students may be struggling. She believes that by creating a scholarship, she could help these students relieve some type of stress and financial relief, even if it is buying their books. She hopes to give more back to her gente.</p>
